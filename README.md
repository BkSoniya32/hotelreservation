# Hotel Reservation System

This is a Java-based Hotel Reservation System that I built during my college studies. I created this project to practice core Java concepts and understand how a real project is structured using Maven. It’s a simple console application, but it helped me learn how reservation systems work and how to organize code properly.

## Overview
The system includes basic hotel booking features such as:
- Creating new reservations
- Checking room availability
- Managing customer details
- Viewing existing bookings

It’s a small project, but it reflects my understanding of Java fundamentals and how to apply them in a real scenario.

## Technologies Used
- Java  
- Maven  
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code  

## Project Structure
src/  
 └── main/  
      └── java/   (Java source files)  
pom.xml           (Maven project file)

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/BkSoniya32/hotelreservation
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code.  
3. Maven will automatically download all required dependencies.  
4. Run the main Java file inside `src/main/java` to start the application.

## Features
- Simple and easy-to-use console interface  
- Basic hotel reservation flow  
- Uses Java OOP concepts  
- Clean Maven project structure
